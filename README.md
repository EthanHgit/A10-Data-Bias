# A10-Data-Bias
This project is meant to test the throsholds for what is considered "toxic" by the Perspective API. We utilize a given dataset containing examples of online user comments in order to test thresholds.

My theory was that the API may be easily fooled by slight modifications to words or unorthodox sentence structure. This was based on my findings from the original dataset.
